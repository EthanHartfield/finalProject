      A lot of people know not to judge books by covers, but the inside of THIS book's contents are pretty much what the cover entailed. 
      What's that white bit on the rim of the left burger--you probably aren't asking?
      I don't know, maybe it's normal, maybe it's not.
      What did you honestly think that we would know how "normal food" is supposed to be?
      Ha! Hilarious...</p>
